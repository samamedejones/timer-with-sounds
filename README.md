![timerR](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c48af03-250b-4c47-bbf3-2f315adbb807)


A timer for those looking to relax or even study with a comfortable sound in the background, it includes play, pause, stop and time adjustment buttons, unique buttons for each type of sound theme, such as fireplace, rain and forest, and even a button to change the audio, the project also has buttons to adjust the volume according to your taste!

## Learnings

In this project I established how to work with more declarative programming, clean code, lots of repetition structure, inclusion of media in the project and if/else. It was a project for beginners but it was quite challenging in terms of logic.
